This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates various graph representations and operations, such as:

Creating and visualizing graphs (directed/undirected).
Analyzing graph properties (nodes, edges, paths).
Implementing graph-related algorithms or metrics.
Potential use of Python libraries like NetworkX for handling graph data.
